Wash everything thoroughly with soap, dry, then clean with EtOH before use. 2. Assemble microgel cast in microgel rack. Leave glass and metal plate ca. 1 mm under the edge of the microgel rack to ensure tight seal. 3. Check the seal with dH2O. Preparing separation gel Be careful when handling acrylamide and bis-acrylamide solutions. Use gloves! 1. Place a filtering flask (min 50ml with hose connection) with a magnet on a stirrer. 2. Combine components of the Separation gel (wait with the APS and TEMED). Let the solution stir slowly for 10 min. 3. Degas for 10 min. 4. Add APS-solution (pipette to mix) and let the solution stir for 2 min. 5. Add TEMED (pipette to mix) and let the solution stir for 45 sec. 6. Using a 10 ml pipette pour 6 ml of solution into the gel cast. 7. Immediately add 0.75 ml isobutanol on top of the gel. 8. Let polymerize at room temperature for 30-90 min. Preparing stacking gel 1. Pour the isobutanol from the separation gel, flush the gel surface with dH2O, pour off (remove the remaining dH2O with paper if necessary. Carefully, without disturbing the gel.) 2. Place a filtering flask (min 50ml with hose connection) with a magnet on a stirrer. 3. Combine components of the Stacking gel (wait with the APS and TEMED). Let the solution stir slowly for 10 min. 4. Add APS-solution (pipette to mix) and let the solution stir for 2 min. 5. Add TEMED (pipette to mix) and let the solution stir for 45 sec. 6. Using a 5-10 ml pipette pour the appropriate amount of solution into the gel cast. Gel should fill the cast to the top. 7. Let polymerize at room temperature for at least 60 min before loading. Preparing Samples (for loading) 1. Complete Protein Extraction, Re-Suspension and Concentration-count (separate protocols) 2. Determine lane loads; 1.5 – 2.5 ug (this determines the dilution concentration you are aming for in the next step). 3. Dilute samples with Kopec Buffer Solution to reach appropriate/equal concentrations (1ug/ul will give you a good loading ammount). 4. Dilute samples with 4x Laemmli Solution Buffer: 1:4 Ratio (3 parts sample/1 part buffer). 5. Incubate 5 min at 95°C 6. Ready to load. NB: Vortex thoroughly at every step! Loading the microgel 1. While the microgel polymerizes, prepare running buffers 2. Take the sandwich out of the stand and attach it to the electrophoresis rack. 3. Mark the bottom of every well with a line and number the gels. NB: for the next steps you need to be efficient! 4. Pour ca. 75ml of “upper” running buffer in the upper chamber. 5. Carefully remove the comb to expose the lanes. 6. Load the gel with the samples according to preplanned loading scheme. Total protein amount should be 1.5-2.5 ug per lane for optimal separation of MyHC IIa and IIx fibers. Do not use lane 1 and 10 (proximity to edge of gel results in smear). 7. Add “lower” running buffer to bottom chamber. 8. Place lid on electrophoresis rack, and place entire apparatus in 4°C environment. 9. Run electrophoresis for 20 hours at 140V Gel staining Use commercial gel staining before visualization."

    "title": "Determining PCR-product sizes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe product size from PCR reactions is determined by primer design and subsequent specificity. A specific primer will produce a product length corresponding to the length of the segment amplified by the primers. If primers are unspecific, covering multiple templates, product lengths will potentially vary. PCR-product size can therefore be used to determine if a PCR reaction has targeted the expected template.\nThis tutorial will show how to determine sizes of PCR products from an agarose gel using ImageJ and R.\n\n\nPrerequisite\nDownload ImageJ Fiji. Examples of data analyses below are performed in R and RStudio.\nA general protocol for agarose gel electrophoresis can be found under protocols.\n\n\nMeasuring product migration distance in ImageJ\n\nStart ImageJ, open up a gel image (Figure 1).\n\n - Invert the image (Shift + Ctrl + I) and rotate it (Image &gt; Transform &gt; Rotate) so that the top of the gel (wells) are on the left (Figure 2).\n - Select the Rectangle tool in ImageJ and draw a box covering the wells of interest and the ladder, press Shift + X to crop the image (Figure 3). Make sure the wells runs horizontally, adjust the rotation otherwise.\n - Using the Rectangle tool, select the well containing the ladder and press Ctrl + 1, move the Rectangle to the next well and press Ctrl + 2. Select all wells of interest using Ctrl + 2 except for the last well, select the last well using Ctrl + 3. A new window will appear (Figure 4).\n - The curves in the new window represents the pixel intensity of each well. Go to the Analyze &gt; Set Measurements in ImageJ and de-select all measurement, a single decimal places is sufficient. Select the Multi-point tool and mark every peak in each well (Figure 5).\n When all peaks are marked press Ctrl + M. A new window should appear with x and y measurements (Figure 6).\n\n\n\nCalculate unknown product sizes based ladder estimates\n\nCreate a spreadsheet with the data collected in ImageJ, alternatively, input your data in R directly (as below). The x-values from ImageJ are the values of interest.\nInput the data detailing the ladder (mw in the example below). We get this information from the description of the ladder. The GeneRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder (Thermo scientific) is used in this example.\n\n\n# Create a data frame of known distances and molecular weights\nladder &lt;- data.frame(dist = c(29, 43.5, 60.5,\n                              80.5, 106.5,  141.5,  \n                              181.5,    243.5,  281.5,\n                              328.5,    390.5,  465.5,  580.5), \n                     mw = c(1000, 900, 800, \n                            700, 600, 500,\n                            400, 300, 250, \n                            200, 150, 100, 50))\n            \n\n# Create a new data frame of unknowns\nunknown &lt;- data.frame(dist = c(470.5,   391.5,  528.5,\n                               421.5,   507.5))\n\n\nDNA fragment sizes will be linear to migration distance when expressed on the log scale. Create a “calibration model” using the ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fit the model\ncal &lt;- lm(log(mw) ~ dist, data = ladder)\n\n# Check model performance, R^2 should be ~ 1.\nsummary(cal)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(mw) ~ dist, data = ladder)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.054731 -0.040851 -0.001577  0.034241  0.063743 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.
